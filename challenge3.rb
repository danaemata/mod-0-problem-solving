#Given an array of strings, return only the words that begin with the letter "t".


# Overall Goal:

# Create an array with strings. The code has to print out words that begin with the letter t.


# Break It Down:
# First we have to create an array. That array has to have strings.
# Look at each string... (.each) (||)
# Use method that will only give us strings that begin with t. (maybe ==)
# End goal is to have code give us the strings that begin with t.
