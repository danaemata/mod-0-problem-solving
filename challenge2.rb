# Start with an array of strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Print every word in all lowercase letters.


# Overall Goal:

# Create an array with strings. Those strings have to be mixed with capitalized and lowercase letters. The code will print out all of the strings in lowercase.


# Break It Down:

# First we have to create an array with strings. Make sure all strings(words) are both capitalized and lowercase. AMOUNT IS UP TO ME.
# Have to look at each string... (.each method) (do) (||)
# Use a method that will print every character in lowercase letters. (.downcase method) 
# End goal is to have code print out all words in lowercase!!!!
